__Running the code__

The file run.py implements the Ridge regression model.
The file run_v2.py implements the Logistic regression model.

• To get the submission.csv file, run

    python run.py

• To get the accuracy of your predictions, you can split the dataset to obtain a training set and a testing set. The training set will be used to train the model. The testing set will be used to estimate the accuracy of the prediction. 

In run.py, choose the seed 'seed' 'and the ratio 'ratio' of the data you will use to train your model (between 0 and 1),: 

    submission = False
    train_ratio = 'ratio'
    seed = 'seed'


You can find other models in implementations.py to do your predictions.
